When developing greenfield projects or new functionality, the only assumptions you can arrive at are:

- Data requirements in terms of initial data and data growth rate will not reflect initial release or future growth
- Utilization will be an unknown or an estimate at best

As responsible developers, we need to proactively design and develop using the tools at hand, appropriately. In this context, the toolset is LINQ.

Here are a couple of concepts with examples of how seemingly small changes to syntax can have a big impact on performance.
